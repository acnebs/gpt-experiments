GPT-4

## Prompts
- > Describe Harry Potter's family tree. I don't need everyone's biographies, just names and relations.
- > Format this as JSON that I can pass to a graphing library and graph the family tree in 2D.
- > Write some D3 code to display this graph.
- > Modify the code to show the direction of the links as arrows

## Bugs
- Despite explicitly asking for them (and GPT-4 modifying the code accordingly), arrows are not actually displayed to show the direction of the graph edges.
