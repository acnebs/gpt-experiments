# gpt-experiments
A bunch of code that was generated by some version of OpenAI's GPT LLM

All the code I was generating every time I had a funny little idea to test with GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, etc was just idling away in either the OpenAI Playground or the ChatGPT history. I thought it would be nice to put everything in a little git repo instead for future reference.
